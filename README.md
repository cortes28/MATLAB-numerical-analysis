# MATLAB-numerical-analysis
A MATLAB dive into solving mathematical problems with mathematical algorithms. Here, the Runge-Kutta method is applied towards a system of differential equations (first order). The Runge-Kutta method can be used for a multitude of problems. In this case, I applied it towards solving the 
'Pond Pollution Problem'. In where connected ponds are being dumped with pollutants and we see how it spreads to each pond as time passes by. with 0.2 gallons being dumped into pond 1 per minute. This led the system of ponds to contain roughly 518 gallons of pollutant in roughly
43 hours (4592 minutes)! The Runge-Kutta DE method has also been given for a differential equation that is not in a system.
